    "1.Bayesian probability allows us to update our beliefs as we get new data, using Bayes’ theorem. This theorem tells us how to combine our prior probability (what we believed before) with the likelihood (how likely the data is given our hypothesis) to get the posterior probability (what we believe after). For example, suppose we have a coin that we suspect is biased, and we want to know the probability that it lands on heads. A Bayesian would assign a prior probability to this hypothesis, such as 0.6, based on their initial guess. Then, they would flip the coin several times and observe the outcomes. Based on the data, they would calculate the likelihood of getting those outcomes if the coin was indeed biased with a 0.6 probability of heads. Finally, they would use Bayes’ theorem to update their prior probability with the likelihood, and get a posterior probability that reflects their updated belief. "
